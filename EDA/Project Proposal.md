# Project Proposal

## Question
WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) has asked the Metis team to assist the organization with filling their gala event with individuals who are passionate about increasing the participation of women in tech. WTWY has a street team with teammates who are placed by different NYC subway station in order to inform people about the organization and gala event. 
The main area of assistance that WTWY is requesting from the Metis team is to build a data analysis model based on the [MTA Turnsile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) **to suggest how to optimize the placement of street team in order to reach out to a higher number of people, gather the most signatures, and ideally reach out to those who are more likely to attend the gala and contribute to the organization cause.**

## Data Description
For this project, I am going to use the publicly available [MTA Turnsile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to gather information on **Entries and Exits data** per **Station**, and the **Dates and Times** that each **Station** is most populated. I predict that more populated stations are an important target for WTWY as it allows their street team to reachout to more people, which correlates to a higher number of signatures. 
I will also research and potentially use databases that map the station and subway lines to a geographical data. A database of this sort helps with identifying locations and subway lines & stations that people are more interested about the cause of WTWY, hence turning the outreach to more signatures, and more people who might actually attend the gala or contribute to the cause. Some of the use case examples of this data could be mapping subway lines and stations to locations that are tech hubs, closer to universities, or are more populated with young professionals.


## Tools
To perform this analysis I am planning to use SQL (SQLite, DB Browser) to store and access data, Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to clean, manipulate and communcate data and Github to store and share project documents such as analysis and presentation.

## MVP Goal
I am going to assist WTWY with finding more populated stations which are suitable targets for placing the street team in order to reach out to more people and gather more signatures.
I also plan to analyze and submit suggestions about how to turn more signatures to more attendance in gala by people who are more likely to contribute to the cause of WTWY.
