# Project Proposal

## Question
[WomenTechWomenYes(WTWY) has asked the Metis team]() to assist the organization with filling their gala event with individuals who are passionate about increasing the participation of women in tech. WTWY has a street team with teammates who are placed by different NYC subway station in order to inform people about the organization and gala event. 
The main area of assistance that WTWY is requesting from the Metis team is to build a data analysis model based on the [MTA Turnsile Data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to suggest how to optimize the placement of street team in order to outreach a higher number of people, gather the most signature, and ideally outreach to those who are more likely to attend the gala and contribute to the organization cause.
