Recently I joined a new Yoga studio that I found for a very reasonable price in my ClassPass yoga studio list. It wasn't until driving to the Studio and trying to find parking 5 min before the session started that I realized that the cost of 1 hour parking near the studio is actually higher than the cost of the Yoga session itself. I realized the need for an interface that can possibly work with Google Maps or Maps that shows you not only parking garages near your destination, but different parking regulations/options near your destination and what you'd end up paying at each of those options, so that you can choose your destination accordingly.

For this project, I plan to obtain parking meter data for major cities in the Bay Area. I intend to analyze the location, regulation and prices of parking meters in each area, and use this analysis to create a streamlit app or another type of interface that suggests parking spots and the price based on your destination. 

My data consists of parking meter locations, regulations and prices. In total I have gathered about ~50k datapoints from the following sources, but I intend to gather more data in the next few days:
- [SF Parking Meters](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Parking-Meters/8vzz-qzz9)
- [Oakland Parking Meters](https://data.oaklandca.gov/w/wnjv-tz7z/default?cur=BvuQ2PVP1Vo&from=WZWfRFSffGf)
- [SF Parking Meter Policies](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Meter-Policies/qq7v-hds4)
- [San Jose Parking Meters](https://data.sanjoseca.gov/dataset/parking-meters1/resource/5b09ac22-ee40-446d-a2b5-62dc9ceb516b)
