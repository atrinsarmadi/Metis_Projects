For this project, I plan to obtain parking meter data for major cities in the Bay Area. I intend to analyze the location, regulation and prices of parking meters in each area, and use this analysis to create a streamlit app that suggests parking spots and the price based on your destination. 

My data consists of parking meter locations, regulations and prices. In total I have gathered about ~50k datapoints from the following sources, but I intend to gather more data in the next few days:
- [SF Parking Meters](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Parking-Meters/8vzz-qzz9)
- [Oakland Parking Meters](https://data.oaklandca.gov/w/wnjv-tz7z/default?cur=BvuQ2PVP1Vo&from=WZWfRFSffGf)
- [SF Parking Meter Policies](https://data.sfgov.org/Transportation/Meter-Policies/qq7v-hds4)
- [San Jose Parking Meters](https://data.sanjoseca.gov/dataset/parking-meters1/resource/5b09ac22-ee40-446d-a2b5-62dc9ceb516b)
