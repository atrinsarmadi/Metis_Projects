For this project, I have obtained parking meter data of the city of San Francisco. I intend to analyze the location, regulation and prices of parking meters in each area, and use this analysis to create a streamlit app interface that suggests parking spots and the price based on your destination. 

Here is a pipeline for this project and some more explanation of the steps and tools.
