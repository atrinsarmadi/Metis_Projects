## SF bike share supply and demand analysis
The objective of this project is to look at the supply and demand trends of the SF Bikeshare Stations in order to find incentives in adding bikes or docks in the current stations or suggest new locations for stations.

### Data Description
The data is downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share), and it includes station location and installation information, status of bikes in each station, trip information between stations and weather data. The data spans between August 2013 and August 2015 which is the first two years of this program. 

### Initial Findings
For first steps of analyzing this data, I merged station information with trip data in order to isolate the stations and trips that were in the city of San Francisco, removing other cities in the Bay Area. Looking at the total trip data from all 2 years
