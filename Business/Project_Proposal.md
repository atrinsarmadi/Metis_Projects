# Project Proposal - SF Bay Area Bike Share Growth Plan

## Question
One of the main objectives of future urban plans is accessibility to greener transporation means. Life after pandemic has also prompted some questions about the future of customized transportation that can increase social distancing and reduce possibilities of another pandemic. [SF Bay Area has long-range plans for 2040 and 2050](https://mtc.ca.gov/planning/long-range-planning) which includes bike share program plans and extension plans. For this project, I would like to study the [SF Bay Area Bike Share dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share) to find growth opportunities based on demand and supply analysis per station, or find potential locations for future stations that leads to increase in use of these bikes in San Francisco.

## Data Description
The data is found from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share), and it includes station location and installation information, status of bikes in each station, trip information between stations and weather data. The data spans between August 2013 and August 2015. 

## Algorithms
Perform complete EDA on the data, and perhaps baseline regression models.

## Tools
EDA will be done in Google Sheets, visualization will be done in Tableau

## MVP Goal
The MVP of this project is to perform EDA on the data to find opportunities for growth in Bike share program market, assisting city of San Francisco to make better decisions about bike resource allocation as well as station locations.
