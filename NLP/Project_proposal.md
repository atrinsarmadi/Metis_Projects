# Project Proposal - Sentiment analysis of Tweets about Meta (formerly known as Facebook)

## Question
On October 28, 2021 Facebook announced the rebranding of their name to Meta. This is more than just a change in name as the reason behind this move has been the focus of Facebook HQ on virtual reality and future of internet. 
This move by Meta and the annoucement by Mark Zuckerberg has had quite a reaction from public on twitter, which can be to some extent described as a backlash. It would be interesting to classify the sentiments behind the tweets about Meta brand name change and how the public thinks about this decision. The public feedback should be of interest for Facebook as a preliminary market analysis for some of the future services and technology that they are developing at the moment, and use the results from this sentiment analysis to adjust future marketing plans.

## Data Description
I will use twitter developer account API and tweepy python package to access tweets about this name change, specifically looking at hashtags such as #Meta #Metaverse #Facebook #Zuckerberg

## Tools and Algorithms
Tools and algorithms include but are not limited to:
- Pandas, numpy, Scikit Learn, SpaCy, NLTK
- NLP: Topic Modeling, K-means Clustering, Dimensionality reduction

## MVP
Preprocessing the data for NLP techniques and creating a baseline topic modeling
