# Project Proposal - Traffic Sign Image Classification

## Question
The goal of this project is to classify images of traffic signs into 43 categories. This image classification will be done using CNN methods and is useful in applications of self-driving cars, where the cameras installed on the car can take images/videos of the surrounding and use the classification of the traffic sign to prompt different signals to the car computer or control system. If time allows, the image classification will be paired with an object detection algorithm which allows using more real world image or videos in real time, detecting where the traffic signs are one the image, then running the classification process.

## Data Description
The data is downloaded from [Keggle](https://www.kaggle.com/valentynsichkar/traffic-signs-preprocessed?select=label_names.csv), includes 43 classes and 2000 images from each category. The data is pre-processed for classification. 

## Tools and Algorithms
Tools and algorithms include but are not limited to:
- Pandas, Numpy, Scikit Learn, Tensorflow Keras, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- CNN for image classification
- YOLO for object detection (if time)

## MVP
Creating some image classification models and working towards optimizing the algorithms
